How do we know what we know and why do we learn what we do? Is public education really in crisis in America and if so, what can we do about it? Is college worth it? What role should education play in an Internet-saturated world? These are just some of the questions various sections might explore.

We will approach such issues as complex historical and cultural constructions open to human intervention and invention, using them as a means of developing the vitally interconnected skills of writing, thinking, and ethical engagement",

How do we know what we know and why do we learn what we do? Is public education really in crisis in America and if so, what can we do about it? Is college worth it? What role should education play in an Internet-saturated world? These are just some of the questions various sections might explore. Students will be encouraged to reflect on their own experiences and move beyond them to engage in key debates about education today, from kindergarten to college and beyond.",

What role should education play in an Internet-saturated world? These are just some of the questions various sections might explore.

              "notes": "This course focuses on how technology both shapes and is shaped by society. In our writing we will analyze claims about technological innovation and develop original arguments about the promises, problems, ethics, and ideologies of this fundamental condition of modern life. Areas for exploration include technological determinism, ethical challenges to technology, political responses to technology, utopianism, and technology's impact of various social systems, ranging from the military to commerce to the family.",

What role should education play in an Internet-saturated world? These are just some of the questions various sections might explore.

We will consider how to define social justice, how social justice gets reflected in real laws in effect today, and whether there are ways in which there is opposition between these two forces. Students will be encouraged to explore a variety of topics such as ethnic\/ educational tracking, access to GPS data, mass DNA records, etc.",
